 Basic instructions to run the project generation.

Run the code to generate the files:

./Wires.py wires.input.D3

(or some other input file like wires.input.fullsector)

Prepare files for graph generation:

./Graph.py

Make graph in root:

root -l
root[0] .L DrawTrackletProject.C++
root[1] DrawTrackletProject()

You can also generate the 'zoomed in' views of all the processing modules
after running the Wires.py script by doing

./generatesubgraphs
